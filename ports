Some FAQ related PORTS

Q. WHAT IS A PORT?
A port is piece of software which is used as docking point in your machine, where remote application can communicate. This is analogy to the physical ports for entering in to a country from different sea ports.

Q. WHAT IS HARDWARE PORT?
This is a physical peripheral connecting point to a machine from a physical device.

Q. WHAT IS A SOCKET?
Socket is combination of software Port and IP address.

Q. WHAT IS THE RANGE OF PORTS OR HOW MANY PORTS ARE THERE?
Port numbers can vary from 0 to 65535, so total we can get 65536 ports

Q. WHY PORT NUMBERS ARE JUST 65536?
This is because limitation in TCP/IP stack where the port number field is just 16bit size. So we get only 2^16(2 to the power of 16) ports which are equal to 65536 available ports

Q. WHAT ARE THE WELL-KNOWN PORTS OR ASSIGNED PORTS OR DEFAULT PORTS?
Well known ports are from 0 to 1023(total 2^10=1024 ports)

Q. WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY DEFAULT PORT?
Default port is a designated port for particular well-known service such as web server, mail server, ftp server etc. By default FTP uses 21 port, DNS uses 53 and Apache uses 80 port.

Q. CAN WE CHANGE DEFAULT PORT FOR A SERVICE(EXAMPLE APACHE, SQUID)?
Yes, we can change. In Apache and DNS we can change this using listen configuration entry in httpd.conf and named.conf. Squid have port entry in it’s squid.conf file to mention port number.

Q. WHAT ARE THE PROTOCOL NUMBERS FOR TCP AND UDP?
Do not confuse this one with port numbers. TCP and UDP have their own numbers in TCP/IP stack.

TCP protocol number: 6

UDP protocol number: 17

Q. IS THERE ANY WAY I CAN SEE ALL THE PORT INFORMATION IN LINUX?
Yes, you can get that from /etc/services files.

Q. HOW CAN I SEE OPEN PORTS IN LINUX?
Use nmap command.
