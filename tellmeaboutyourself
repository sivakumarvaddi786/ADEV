“Honestly, I had the opportunity to work with the most amazing team and colleagues possible.

Not only did they treat me like an equal despite being a fresher, but they also helped me learn and guided me whenever I required a little help.

But after working there for 3 years now, I am looking forward to a fresh set of challenges and the job profile offered by you seems perfect.

It would help me to push my limits and get out of my comfort zone and I am sure I will be able to add value to the team as well.”
