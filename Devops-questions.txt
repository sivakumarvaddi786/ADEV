What is Devops?

Simplyfy the release process with fast release with high quality and reliability.
Planning ==> Code ==> Build ==> Test ==> Release ==> Deploy ==> Operate ==> Monitoring


Agile vs Devops
Agile(scrum) is framework.
scrum defines development activity as sprint or iteratability.
Frame work is defined and development practices fits into the framework.

Devops is Practive
ENDTOEND SDLC life cycle.
Development ==> Testing ==> Operations ==> Production support.
Each organisation has the Devops practices defined uniquely to meet the needs of the organiation.


Why Devops?
Dev + Ops
Increase the Deploymnet frequency.
Low failure rate of new instance.
Shortened lead time between fixes.
faster mean time to recovery in the event of new release failure.


Devops Tools?
Git - Distributed version control system SVN: client server based system.
Jenkins
chef, puppet, Ansible (Provisions the testing and production servers)
Docker containers provide the consistent computing environmnet throughout the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)


Git commands:
git config -l
git add flle
git commit -m "commit message"(commit a message)
git push
git revert "bad commit" (revet the commit)
git diff--tree -r {hash}    (list all the files that changed or added in that commit)
git diff--tree --no-commit-id --name-only -r {hash}
git reset --soft HEAD~N && (squash last N commits)
git commit
git reset --soft HEAD~N &&
git commit --edit -m "$(git log --format=%B --reverse .HEAD@{N})"


Continious Interation:
new commit  ==> compiled ==> build ==> Deploy(integrated).

Continious Deployment:

Continious Delevery:

Name some Jenkins Plugins

Git Plugin
SSH Plugin
Build Pipeline Plugin
Email-ext Plugin
HTML Publisher Plugin
Multi-slave  config plugins
Parameterized Trigger Plugin



Jenkins Security?
Ensure Global Security is ON.
Ensure Jenkins is integrated with Company AD server.
Ensure that matrix/Project Matrix is enabled to fine tune access.
Automate the process of setting rights/privilages in jenkins with custom version controlled script.
Limit Physical access to Jenkins data/folders
periodically run scripts audits on same.


BackUp and Copy?
Move jobs folder from Old to New Jenkins Server.
Make a copy of an existing job by making a clone of a job birectory by a different name.
Rename the existing job by renaming a directory. Note that if any change to a job name you will need to change any other job that tries to call the renamed job.


Configuration Management?
Configuration Identification
Change Management
Configuration Status Accounting
Configuration Audits.


Diff Asset Management VS Configuration Management?



Infrastructure as Code(Iac)?
Automation of IT Operations(build, Deploy & Manage) by Provisioning Code, rather than Manual Process

Code for the Infrastructure (DEV, TEST & PROD)

Provisioning of Dev, Test and Prod environment by writing code in one centralized location. 



Chef Architecture:
Chef Server: Cetralized server to store the configuration 

Chef Node: Systems Managed by Chef are called Nodes.
          Chef client runs on the node, retriving configuration from chef server.
	  Chef client and Knife use API clients to talk to the chef server.
          Chef Node can be cloud based, Virual or Physical machine in Data Center.

Chef Workstation: Machine with local chef repository & properly configured Knife.
                  All the configuration firsted tested in the workstation and then pushed to Chef Server

Knife: Used to upload configuration to Chef server.Knife is used to communicate with Nodes using SSH

Cookbook: Is a code chef language. what packaged to be deployed, folder or configuration required.
Cookbook has metadata and configuration to install packages.

package 'httpd'
service 'httpd' do
action [:enable, :start]
end

file '/var/www/html/index.html' do
action :create
content 'Welcome to Chef'
end

Chef testing: Chef inspect or kitchen testing tools.



Ansible Architecture
